\title{Creates a subset of a serological survey}
\usage{
\method{subset}{SeroData}(data, sub = seq(1, data$N), loc = NULL, category = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sub}{Used in the \code{subset} function. A list of the indices of the individuals to be considered in the new \code{SeroData} object.}

\item{loc}{Used in the \code{subset} function. A list of the \code{location} of the individuals to be considered in the new  \code{SeroData} object.}

\item{sex}{An optional character factor defining the sex of the individuals. It can be a single chain of characters or a vector of the same size as the number of sampled individuals. Default = \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}
}
\value{
A list with the class \code{SeroData}, which contains the
following items:

\itemize{

\item age: A vector of integers containing the age of the sampled individuals at the time of the latest sampling, of length N.

\item age_at_sampling: A vector of integers containing the age of the sampled individuals at the time of sampling, of length N.

\item Y: A vector of seropositivity status, of length N.

\item N: The number of individuals considered.

\item A: The maximal age.

\item NGroups: The total number of age groups.

\item sampling_year: A vector of sampling years, of length N.

\item location: A vector of the sampling location, of length N.

\item sex: A vector of the sex of each individual, of length N.

}
}
\description{
This function creates a serological survey of the class \code{SeroData}.
}
\examples{

## A very simple example of a serological survey with three individuals: 
data = SeroData(age_at_sampling = c(10,32,24), Y=c(0,1,1), max_age = 50, age_cats = 1, sampling_year = 2017)

seroprevalence(data = data)
data2 = subset(data,c(1,3))

# add example with subset(data, location)
