# Rsero: Estimate the annual force of infection using serological data

Rsero is an R package dedicated to the implementation of serocatalytic
models that are used to estimate the force of infection from
age-stratified serological surveys.

Estimations requires:  
- The age of each individual

-   Their seropositivity status

-   The year of sampling

-   A model of pathogen circulation

The package provides a standardized framework to store serological data,
analyze serological surveys, use a variety of serocatalytic models, run
MCMC algorithm to estimate the parameters of the force of infection, and
analyse the results.

## Installation

To install the package, type

``` r
devtools::install_github("nathoze/Rsero")
```

(This step requires that the package *devtools* is installed).
Installation may take a few minutes due to the compilation of the stan
files that encode the serocatalytic models.

MCMC simulations are done using the package rstan, that requires Rtools
3.3 on Windows computers. Rtools 4.3 can be found here
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

On Windows 10, you may have to install the package wit this command

``` r
devtools::install_github("nathoze/Rsero", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")
```

## More details

More details on the functions can be found in the documentation. The
serocatalytic models are described in details in the vignette *models*.
This vignette includes several examples and shows the different features
of the packages.

## Working with serological data

One of the feature of *Rsero* is to store serological data in a standard
format to permit some estimations and fit with serocatalytic models. A
serological survey contains primarily the age and seropositivity status
of the individuals, and can also contain information such as the sex,
the location and the year of sampling, or categories of individuals that
have a different risk of exposure.

Letâ€™s work on a toy example with simulated data: 500 individuals aged 1
to 70 yo, with a probability of infection of 0.2.

``` r
library(Rsero)
p.infection=0.2
N.samples=500
age = round(runif(n=N.samples, min =1, max = 70))
seropositive = runif(n=N.samples)<p.infection 
```

Now we write these data as a *SeroData*, the type of data used in the
package

``` r
simulated.survey  = SeroData(age_at_sampling = age, Y = seropositive) 
```

This is the minimum requirement for creating a *SeroData* and it can be
already used for the model fit. However we can still enter more
information about the survey. Suppose the first 250 are males, the last
250 are females, that they were all sampled in 2015 in Paris.

``` r
sex= c(rep('males',250), rep('females', 250))
simulated.survey  = SeroData(age_at_sampling =  age,
                             Y = seropositive,
                             sex = sex,
                             location  = 'Paris',
                             sampling_year = 2015) 
```

Some basic analysis can be done on this dataset. The seroprevalence is
obtained by calling the function *seroprevalence* and the age-profile of
seroprevalence by calling *seroprevalence.plot*

``` r
seroprevalence(simulated.survey)
#> [1] "Mean: 0.2    2.5%: 0.16    97.5%: 0.24"
seroprevalence.plot(simulated.survey,YLIM=0.3)
#> [[1]]
```

![](README-dataexample4-1.png)

If for instance we want to estimate different values of the force of
infection for males and females, the variable *category* has to be
defined:

``` r
sex= c(rep('males',250), rep('females', 250))
simulated.survey  = SeroData(age_at_sampling =  age, Y = seropositive, sex = sex, location  = 'Paris', sampling_year = 2015, category = sex) 
```

## Example.

In this example we show the basic steps to follow to get a complete
analysis of a serological survey. This analysis uses a simulated dataset
containing samples of 500 individuals.

``` r
data('one_peak_simulation')
```

The data is saved under a custom format *SeroData*, which stores
information about the serological surveys and details on the
participants. Basic information such as the seroprevalence can be
obtained simply by typing

``` r
seroprevalence(one_peak_simulation)
#> [1] "Mean: 0.11    2.5%: 0.09    97.5%: 0.15"
```

and a graph of the age profile of seroprevalence is obtained using

``` r
seroprevalence.plot(one_peak_simulation)
#> [[1]]
```

![](README-seroprevalenceplot-1.png)

Age-stratified serological surveys assess immunological markers of past
infections and can be used to reconstruct the historical patterns of the
circulation of an infectious disease and the force of infection (the per
capita rate at which susceptible individuals will be infected a given
year). Such inference is performed using serocatalytic models. The Rsero
package proposes several models that can be fitted to the data using the
command

``` r
FOIfit = fit( data = one_peak_simulation,  model = seromodel)
```

In its basic form a model is defined by specifying the mode of
circulation of the pathogen. The simplest type of model assumes a
constant force of infection. We define it with the command

``` r
ConstantModel = FOImodel(type = 'constant')
```

We can now fit the defined model to the data:

``` r
FOIfit.constant = fit(data = one_peak_simulation,  model = ConstantModel, chains=1)
#> 
#> SAMPLING FOR MODEL 'constant' NOW (CHAIN 1).
#> Chain 1: Rejecting initial value:
#> Chain 1:   Log probability evaluates to log(0), i.e. negative infinity.
#> Chain 1:   Stan can't start sampling from this initial value.

#> Chain 1: Gradient evaluation took 0.000121 seconds

#> Chain 1: 
#> Chain 1:  Elapsed Time: 1.819 seconds (Warm-up)

#> Chain 1:
```

(we simulate only one MCMC chain here). We now visualize the result of
the fit

``` r
seroprevalence.fit(FOIfit.constant, YLIM=0.5)
#> [[1]]
```

![](README-fitplot1-1.png)

Here the solid line is the mean annual FOI obtained from the MCMC
simulations and the envelope is the 95% credible interval. This seems
not a very good fit. Indeed younger individuals are all seronegative,
which suggests that the pathogen did not circulate in the recent years.
Several other models could explain the data. For instance we define a
model of one outbreak.

``` r
OutbreakModel = FOImodel( type='outbreak', K=1)
```

We can now fit the defined model to the data:

``` r
FOIfit.outbreak = fit( data = one_peak_simulation,  model = OutbreakModel, chains=1)
#> 
#> SAMPLING FOR MODEL 'outbreak' NOW (CHAIN 1).
#> Chain 1: Rejecting initial value:

#> Chain 1:   Stan can't start sampling from this initial value.

#> Chain 1: Iteration: 1000 / 5000 [ 20%]  (Warmup)

#> Chain 1: Iteration: 4500 / 5000 [ 90%]  (Sampling)
#> Chain 1: Iteration: 5000 / 5000 [100%]  (Sampling)

```

and we plot the result

``` r
seroprevalence.fit(FOIfit.outbreak)
#> [[1]]
```

![](README-fitplot2-1.png)

Visually, this a better fit (and it is not surprising given the way the
data was generated). We can compare the results of the fit using the
deviance information criterion (DIC).

``` r
DIC.constant = compute_information_criteria(FOIfit.constant)
DIC.outbreak = compute_information_criteria(FOIfit.outbreak)
```

The DIC obtained for the outbreak model is lower than that for the
constant model. This indicates a better fit of the outbreak model to the
data.
